Ressources and materials for the course Gestural Mobile Interaction at University Paris-Saclay

Coordinators: Baptiste Caramiaux (CNRS, LRI UPSud) and Eric Lecolinet (Télécom ParisTech LTCI) 

## Description

Gestural interaction is used as input modality in interfaces through a wide variety of gestures and movements: from deterministic and specific ones such as finger tapping on a touch screen to expressive whole-body interaction techniques. This course presents some techniques for capture, recognition and interpretation of gestures. Despite their diversity all these techniques have as common ground the human body with its capabilities and limitation for which interfaces must adapt and provide means of appropriate interaction.

## Program
All classes are on Friday afternoon (13h30-16h30)
